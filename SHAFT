I actually like Isaac quite a lot. But the implementation was broken and there
were hardly any tests available, so I took some time to do a complete rewrite.
This time we have extensive (and retarded) testing, and while rewriting it I
realized that I could simplify the message queue quite a lot and get rid of all
threads and what not. So, here it is.

New features? Hardly any. But, you can now halt an event, like this:

  on :channel, // do
    halt unless nick == "spicoli"
    # .. never gets here unless the message
    # is from a user named 'spicoli'.
  end

And regular expression captures will eventually be handed over to block
arguments:

  on :channel, /(foo) (bar)/ do |a,b|
    a #=> foo
    b #=> bar
  end

Or, that is - it *will* be implemented, eventually.

Enjoy.
